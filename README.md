### Description

A simple PHP script to find characters from the Harry Potter API, allowing you to 
search by name or house. 

### Usage:

`php FindCharacters.php --key <API key> [--house <house>] [--name <name>]`

Lists the names of the found characters.
Name is a partial search, so "Weasley" will find "Ron Weasley" and "George Weasley".
